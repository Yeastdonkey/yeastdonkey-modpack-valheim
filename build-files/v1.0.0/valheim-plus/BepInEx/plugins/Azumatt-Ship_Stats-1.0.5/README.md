> # Description

### A simple mod that I made at request. Shows the stats of the ship that you are currently on. This is a client only mod. It does not need to be installed on the server.

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`


> ## Installation Instructions
***You must have BepInEx installed correctly! I can not stress this enough.***

#### Windows (Steam)
1. Locate your game folder manually or start Steam client and :
* Right click the Valheim game in your steam library
* "Go to Manage" -> "Browse local files"
* Steam should open your game folder
2. Extract the contents of the archive into the BepInEx\plugins folder.
3. Locate Azumatt.ShipStats.cfg under BepInEx\config and configure the mod to your needs

#### Server
`This mod is not needed on a server. It's client only. Install on each client that you wish to have the mod load.`



`Feel free to reach out to me on discord if you need manual download assistance.`
