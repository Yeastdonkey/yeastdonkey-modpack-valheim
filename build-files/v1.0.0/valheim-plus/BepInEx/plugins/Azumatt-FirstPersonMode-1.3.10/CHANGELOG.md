| 1.3.5     | - Add a configuration option for Max Deviation. `Max deviation angle before rotating the player. This is essentially the same thing as a 'Deadzone' for the camera. Similar to how a controller has a deadzone for the joystick.`<br/>- Also add Slerp to the player's rotation to hope make a bit smoother rotations to the player model when looking left or right after you're out of the deadzone. Essentially, just exposing these values so you can change however you want.<br/> - Added configuration option for the Slerp multiplication as well. Higher values will make the camera move faster (The player's rotation will match the target rotation more quickly. This can make the rotation feel more immediate but might appear less smooth if the change is too rapid.), lower values will make the camera move slower. (The player's rotation will take longer to match the target rotation. This will make the transition appear smoother but might feel laggy if too slow.)<br/> - README.md updated to reflect the new configuration options. |
| 1.3.4     | - Revert how I check for the scrollwheel. No longer mimicking vanilla <br/>- Fix an issue with the use of the Barber Station<br/> - Add smoothing to the camera distance changes<br/> - Hide the CapeAsh when in first person mode to get rid of the annoying thing in your face. Unfortunately this hides the whole cape since it's one piece, but, oh well. <br/> - Explicitly state in the code, that the mod isn't required on servers. If it's installed on both it will sync the configurations to those that have the mod.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
