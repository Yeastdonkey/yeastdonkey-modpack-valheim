# Newtonsoft Json.NET

Shared version 13.0.3 of Json.NET from Newtonsoft, net45 package for use in Valheim mods.
Maintained by the ValheimModding team.

The Thunderstore package version may differ slightly from 13.0.3, and the detector shows 13.0.0 because of the internal Newtonsoft.Json assembly version.

## Players

This is an external dependency that mods can reference to help with usage and management of specific kinds of files.
If the mod you are using has a dependency on this package you must install it for the mod to function correctly.
If manually installing mods add the `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` file to your `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

## Mod Creators

Download and reference this package in your mod solution.
Use a dependency reference in the manifest when uploading your mods to Thunderstore.

**Do not include these files in your mod upload!**
