| 2.1.4     | - Salutations, Keyboard Warriors and Mouse Monarchs! It's me again, your friendly neighborhood coder (or car warranty guy if you're annoyed with me), armed with another hotfix update hotter than a graphics card in a marathon gaming session. A quirky bug where your beloved player character decided to take an unexpected permanent vacation when using AdventureBackpack alongside this mod was found. Since Goldenrevolver also had the same issue, he got me the fix as well. Shoutout to him.<br/> - But wait, there's more! I added a component that will reduce the amount of times a container is pinged. And because I know that nobody likes to be pinged over and over (looking at you, group chats), this feature has manners. It won't ping a container that's already felt the sweet ping of attention. That's one less issue to clutter your adventure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 2.1.0     | - Performance improvements when storing things. It now checks more on an interval of 10 seconds. Though, if you throw out an item it will check within the next second. Also, reduced checks that might be a little expensive.<br/> - `Add in Favoriting from Goldenrevolver` By holding the Favoriting Key (default: Alt) or by using a new button, you can left click on an item to favorite it, or right click to favorite the slot it is in. This prevents most features of this mod from affecting it. No accidental quick stacking, sorting, storing or trashing. The favoriting state is shown with a custom colored border around the slot. None of the configuration options related to favoriting are synced with the server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 2.0.0     | - `MAJOR VERSION UPDATE`<br/> - Everything about the configuration has changed. Please delete your old config file and boot the game once with this mod installed to get a clean one.<br/> - Move as many of the configuration options that make sense to YAML configuration. Please read the mod page for details on where to find and read the file for how to use. Ask questions if you need to  in my discord. As frequent questions are asked, they will be added to the wiki tab for this mod. Read the FAQ section on the mod page for more details on that. <br/>- If you have used AzuCraftyBoxes in the past, the configuration is pretty much the same! Works the same, just in reverse (because we are storing things!)<br/> - Main difference between this and AzuCraftyBoxes configurations is that the range can be set in the yaml per container.<br/> - `TLDR;` This update breaks shit because it's a major change, if you are using the mod, delete everything (configuration file and dll). Start over. Read the mod page you lazy person...or figure it out on your own if you're not a smoothbrain                                                                                                     |
