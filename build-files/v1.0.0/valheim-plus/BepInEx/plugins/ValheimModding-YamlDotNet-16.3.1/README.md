# YamlDotNet

Shared version 16.3.0 of YamlDotNet from Antoine Aubry and contributors, net47 package for use in Valheim mods.
Maintained by the ValheimModding team.

The Thunderstore package version may differ slightly from 16.3.0, and the detector shows 16.0.0 because of the internal YamlDotNet assembly version.

## Players

This is an external dependency that mods can reference to help with usage and management of specific kinds of files.
